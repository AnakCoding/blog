Welcome to the NTPsec Project Blog!

As interest in the NTPsec project grows, we see the need for a
regularly updated blog.  Expect to see release announcements, news,
and articles of the ongoing saga of refactoring and modernizing
NTP Classic into NTPsec.

This very blog is itself an [open source project][ntpsec-blog-git],
processed by Jekyll and GitLab-CI, and hosted by GitLab pages.
