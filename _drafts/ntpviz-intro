Ask two different people how accurate their NTP servers are, and you
will get at least four different answers.  Ask two different people
the effect of changing a setting in ntp.conf, and you will get at 
least four different answers.

== "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it." - Lord Kelvin

NTP has long had log files containing lots of measurements about the
functioning of the NTP daemon, but there was no methodology to analyze
or visualize that data using basic statistical principles.

This is changed by ntpviz.  A sysadmin can now unambiguously assess
the short and long term performance of his NTP.  This allows the
sysadmin to run tests of varying configurations and quantize the
effects the changes make.  Best of all, once installed, ntpviz
runs totally unattended, making sure the data is predigested when
the sysadmin wants to see it.

This post will help the reader to install, and run, a basic ntpviz
setup.  Later posts will explore the results of running ntpviz on
different hosts and with different NTP configurations.

== Enough theory, show me the data

NTPsec is under active development, and few distros ship NTPsec packaes yet.
So for now just get a copy of the latest  source and install it.  Here is
how i do it:

----
su -
mkdir -p /usr/local/src/NTP/
cd /usr/local/src/NTP/
git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec.git
cd ntpsec
./waf configure --refclock=all && ./waf build  && ./waf install
cp contrib/ntp.conf.log.sample /etc/ntp.conf
----

Easy, you now have NTPsec, and a basic ntp.conf installed.  Be carefull,
your distribution may over write your new /etc/ntp.conf file.  You
can find more detailed installation instructions, and dependency
information, in the INSTALL file located in the project top level
directory.
