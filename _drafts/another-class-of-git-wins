When we forked the NTPsec codebase from NTP Classic, the codebase and
file tree were full of code and scripts of marginal value, and the
headaround costs of navigating it often made their value negative.

This is not at all intended to speak ill of the past contributors and
maintainers of NTP Classic.  Like as in so many other things, culture
follows tools, and the tools that were available for most of NTP's
history all but demanded that a project as important and as
interesting as NTP would accumulate distracting low quality detritus.

weakness of earlier source control
use of tarball as the working artifact
no easy use of working branches
means partial work and experiments have to be at tip

now with git, experiments are to stay in a branch, and then merge to tip at once
partial work remains out of the way

contributions are gifts
contrib/ directory
accumate over time, and bitrot

Code is expensive to write, and you never know when there will be
value in some of it, even in bitrot scripts, and half-done
experiments, so a culture develops to never throw anything away.

Git changes all that.

As we cleaned up, refactored, and shrunk the codebase and tree for
NTPsec, we realized we never have to think "that might be valuable
someday", because it will always exist in the git history.

Many other projects still have not realized this truth, but more and more will.

Don't worry about cutting things out, they will remain in the history
if you ever need to read them again.
