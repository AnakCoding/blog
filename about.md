Welcome to the NTPsec Project development  - a blog about developing and
using NTPsec.   NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved
implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave
Mills's original.

NTPsec, as its name implies, is a more secure NTP.  Our goal is to
deliver code that can be used with confidence in deployments with the
most stringent security, availability, and assurance requirements.

Towards that end, we apply best practices and state-of-the art
technology in code auditing, verification, and testing. We begin with
the most important best practice: true open-source code review.  The
NTPsec code is available in our main
[public git repository](https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec.git)
One of our goals is to support broader community articipation.
